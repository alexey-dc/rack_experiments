# At last.. engineered!... to be exactly 0 on start, and only then.
# No process dare step on this only once initialized value -
# and reinitialize it once more to the same value.
# No client dare interject his request in the submilimicrosecond
# between the first thread initializing it and the next one
# overriding it, ultimately corrupting the result of the test -
# as the fleeting increment of the first HTTP request dwindles
# into oblivion....
